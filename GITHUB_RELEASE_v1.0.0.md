# üéâ Color Utils v1.0.0 - Adaptive Oklab with Advanced Tone Mapping

## Major Release Highlights

This release introduces **Adaptive Oklab (Aoklab)** with sophisticated tone mapping, providing perceptually uniform colors across different viewing conditions - from dark cinema rooms to bright outdoor displays.

## ‚ú® Key Features

### üé® Enhanced Adaptive Oklab
- **Two-layer tone mapping**: Gamma adjustment + sigmoid enhancement
- **Empirically-calibrated presets**: Based on perceptual testing matching CIELAB
- **Universal shadow lifting**: All surrounds use sigmoid=1.0 for perceptual uniformity
- **Improved shadow separation**: Critical for dark mode UIs and design systems

### üì¶ New Presets Module
```javascript
import { createAoklabForSurround } from '@markgorzynski/color-utils';

// Create for typical office viewing
const aoklab = createAoklabForSurround('gray');
const color = aoklab.fromHex('#336699');
```

### üìä Calibrated Settings
All presets use maximum shadow lifting (sigmoid = 1.0):
- **black**: Œ≥=1.05 (cinema/dark room)
- **dark**: Œ≥=1.10 (dim room)  
- **gray**: Œ≥=0.85 (office - matches CIELAB)
- **light**: Œ≥=0.80 (bright room)
- **white**: Œ≥=0.75 (outdoor/sunlight)

## üî¨ Technical Improvements

### Refined Tone Mapping
- Shadow lift multiplier increased 50% (0.2 ‚Üí 0.3)
- Contrast enhancement multiplier increased 60% (5 ‚Üí 8)
- Smooth shadow lifting in 0-50% range
- Mathematical guarantees against black clipping

### Biological Basis
The model compensates for:
- Human vision's evolution for bright daylight conditions
- Neural compression that affects shadows more than highlights
- Oklab's dark-optimization requiring compensation for typical viewing

## üìö Documentation

- Complete guide: [Adaptive Oklab Guide](https://markgorzynski.github.io/color-utils/aoklab-guide.md)
- API Reference: [Full API Documentation](https://markgorzynski.github.io/color-utils/API.html)
- JSDoc: [Auto-generated docs](https://markgorzynski.github.io/color-utils/api/)

## üéØ Use Cases

### UI Design Systems
- Create perceptually uniform color scales
- Ensure proper shadow separation in dark modes
- Maintain consistent contrast across viewing conditions

### Cross-Media Color Matching
- Design on screen, adapt for different viewing conditions
- Match colors between devices with different surrounds
- Consistent brand colors across media

## üíª Installation

```bash
npm install @markgorzynski/color-utils@1.0.0
```

## üîÑ Migration from v0.x

The core API remains compatible. New features are additive:
- Existing `AdaptiveOklab` class enhanced with `toneMapping` option
- New `aoklab-defaults` module for convenience
- Presets can be used or custom parameters specified

**Note**: While the API is compatible, colors will appear different (better!) due to refined tone mapping.

## üêõ Bug Fixes
- Fixed sigmoid discontinuity at midpoint
- Resolved black clipping in shadow lifting
- Corrected polarity in contrast enhancement

## üôè Acknowledgments

Special thanks to empirical testing that revealed:
- Oklab's dark-optimization isn't suitable for typical viewing
- Maximum shadow lifting needed for perceptual uniformity
- Human vision's evolutionary bias toward bright conditions
