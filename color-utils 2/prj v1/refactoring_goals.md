# Refactoring Goals

**Objective:** To refactor the existing color utility JavaScript libraries into a modular, well-documented, and maintainable codebase.

**High-Level Success Criteria:**

- **Improved Modularity:**
    - Organize all color conversion functions into discrete ES6 modules, categorized by color space (e.g., `srgb.js`, `cielab.js`, `oklab.js`).
    - Centralize common utility functions into a shared module (e.g., `utils.js`).
- **Consistent API Design:**
    - Establish and adhere to a consistent design for all public-facing functions and classes.
    - Define standardized color object structures for each color space (e.g., `{r, g, b}` for sRGB, `{L, a, b}` for Lab).
    - Specify expected units and numerical ranges for all color parameters.
- **Comprehensive Documentation:**
    - Implement comprehensive JSDoc comments for all modules, functions, classes, and type definitions.
    - Generate an API reference manual.
- **Enhanced Testability:**
    - Ensure the refactored code is easily testable with unit tests.
    - Develop a suite of unit tests covering core logic, conversions, and edge cases.
- **Cohesive Library Integration:**
    - Integrate all provided scripts and functionalities into a single, cohesive library.
- **Consistent Error Handling:**
    - Implement a consistent strategy for handling errors and invalid inputs across the library.
- **Maintainability:**
    - Produce a codebase that is easy to understand, modify, and extend in the future.
- **Usability**:
	- Comprehensive documentation as mentioned above.
	- Libraries include helper and demo templates that streamline use.
- **Specific Functional Goals (Examples to be detailed further):**
    - Ensure accurate color space conversions (e.g., sRGB <-> Linear sRGB, Linear sRGB <-> XYZ, XYZ <-> CIELAB, etc.).
    - Follow standards when ever available.  This includes w3c / css standards and color standards.  
    - Support forward and reverse transformation between key color spaces including (e.g., gamma-corrected sRGB, linear sRGB, CIELAB, oklab, ciecam16)
    - Support common color encodings such as sRGB in Hex vs float vs RGB.
    - Provide reliable color difference calculations (e.g., CIEDE2000, WCAG contrast).
    - Implement configurable appearance models (e.g., CIECAM16, Adaptive Oklab).
    - If `chroma-control.js` and `matchoklch.v3.js` are included, ensure their functionalities are preserved or appropriately refactored/reimplemented.
